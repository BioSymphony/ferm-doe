# Product Brief

## Name

BioSymphony Ferm DoE

## Thesis

The highest ROI in fermentation planning is upstream of the physical experiment: deciding whether the campaign is ready, what the lab can actually run, which data can be trusted, which hypotheses are plausible, and which design will teach the most per run.

## Product Unit

The product unit is a campaign dossier:

## Readiness Verdict

Every campaign should produce a hard status before physical setup:

- `GREEN`: ready to run first-batch
- `YELLOW`: runnable with explicit caveats
- `RED`: do not run yet; fix assay, data, constraints, objective, or safety blockers

## High-ROI Modules

1. Campaign contract compiler
2. Historical data rescue and trust scoring
3. Factor universe builder
4. Assay and measurement readiness gate
5. Constraint and feasibility solver
6. Bottleneck hypothesis engine
7. Design tournament
8. Pre-registered follow-up decision rules
9. Experiment packet compiler
10. Negative-result memory
11. Joined contract self-check and claim audit

## V1 Wedge

Given a fermentation goal, optional historical CSVs, approximate reagent inventory, and equipment capacity, generate:

- readiness verdict
- cleaned run ledger
- factor-space draft
- assay readiness checklist
- feasibility report
- selected first-batch design stub
- lab-ready packet outline
- Linear issues for Symphony execution
