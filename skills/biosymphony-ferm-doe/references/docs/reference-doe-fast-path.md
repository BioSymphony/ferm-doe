# Reference DOE Fast Path

## Product Intent

Many fermentation users already know commercial DOE software. BioSymphony Ferm DoE should give those users a familiar DOE path while adding campaign intelligence that generic DOE tools do not own: assay readiness, scale-transfer logic, process-phase constraints, cost/time scoring, lab packets, and follow-up memory.

This is not a promise that every commercial DOE method is fully reimplemented today. BioSymphony now emits executable reference DOE artifacts locally, and every metric is labeled as exact, adapter-backed, approximate, or heuristic.

## User-Facing Positioning

BioSymphony should be able to say:

```text
If you would normally open Custom Design, Screening, RSM, Mixture,
Space-Filling, Augment Design, or Bayesian Optimization, start here instead.
We will build the DOE table, but we will also check whether the experiment is
actually biologically measurable, physically runnable, and worth running.
```

## Parity Matrix

| Reference DOE Surface | BioSymphony Fast-Path Target | BioSymphony Add-On |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Custom Design | Factor model, terms, constraints, run budget, randomization, blocking, hard-to-change factors | Translate fermentation reality into constraints before design generation |
| Screening / DSD | Fractional, Plackett-Burman, DSD-like, main-effect and mixed-factor screening | Factor-prior audit from literature, prior runs, phase structure, and product class |
| RSM | CCD, Box-Behnken, custom quadratic candidates, center/lack-of-fit runs | Block RSM when assay noise or response semantics are not ready |
| Mixture | Mixture bounds, sum constraints, mixture-process interactions | Convert media/feed components into recipe tables, feasibility, and cost burden |
| Space-Filling | LHS/Sobol/Halton/scouting candidates with coverage diagnostics | Use only when campaign priors justify scouting; pre-register follow-up narrowing rules |
| Diagnostics | Rank, estimability, alias/correlation, D/I/A/G proxies, FDS, prediction variance, power assumptions | Add assay power, sampling burden, oxygen/feed/pH risk, and cost/run diagnostics |
| Compare Designs | Side-by-side scorecards and selected design rationale | Multi-agent tournament with skeptical assay/process/cost lanes |
| Augment Design | Append runs to locked historical/current design under updated model | Recommend confirm, narrow, expand, pause, stop, or scale/downscale |
| Bayesian Optimization | Historical data to candidate set, batch selection, stopping recommendation | BO is gated by assay/readiness, phase logic, and negative-result memory |
| Profiler / Prediction | Prediction model and operating-window report | Operating window includes fermentation caveats and lab execution packet |

## Implementation Shape

Add a workflow mode named `reference-doe-engine`. It should be selected when users mention commercial/reference DOE, Custom Design, DSD, RSM, mixture, space-filling, augment design, Bayesian optimization, or "DOE comparable."

The mode must produce:

- `doe_parity_report.md`
- `doe_parity_matrix.json`
- `design_candidates/*.csv`
- `design_candidates/*.scorecard.json`
- `design_candidates/*.model_matrix.csv`
- `design_candidates/*.diagnostics.json`
- `design_diagnostics.json`
- `design_comparison.json`
- `design_comparison.md`
- `selected_wave_1_design.csv`
- `doe_reference_export.csv`
- `assumptions_and_nonparity.md`

The starter fast-path example is:

```bash
ferm-doe engine compile-dossier \
  --manifest examples/reference-doe-custom-design/campaign_manifest.json \
  --out .runtime/doe-fast-path-dossier \
  --run-budget 14
```

Optional reference DOE utilities are available when a user wants a more reference DOE-like inspection path without making those utilities mandatory:

- `ferm-doe engine utility custom-optimal` - constrained D/I/A/G-style row selection with fixed controls and trace output.
- `ferm-doe engine utility augment-design` - actual next-run rows from locked results and remaining budget.
- `ferm-doe engine utility profiler` - local prediction/operating-window report after results exist.
- `ferm-doe engine utility simulate-design` - deterministic effect/noise simulation and power proxy.
- `ferm-doe engine utility doe-export` - simple CSV import/export bridge for DOE-oriented users.
- `ferm-doe engine utility benchmark-doe` - synthetic property harness for parity claims.
- `ferm-doe engine utility check-deps` - optional adapter availability report.

Every utility emits `utility_manifest.json` with backend, dependency status, metric labels, artifacts, and caveats.

## Worker Campaign

Use `packs/issue-packs/doe-parity-v0/` when the goal is specifically to raise DOE statistical parity. Keep it separate from normal fermentation readiness so the default product does not become a generic DOE clone.

The campaign should prioritize:

1. true custom design model matrices and optimality metrics
2. DSD/screening/RSM/mixture/space-filling generators
3. design diagnostics and compare-design reports
4. augmentation and result-ingestion-backed next-run selection
5. optional Bayesian optimization adapters
6. user-facing parity report and examples

## Product Bar

This path is successful when a DOE software user can inspect a BioSymphony dossier and find:

- the design class they expected
- familiar diagnostics and assumptions
- a clear reason for selected design
- exportable design tables
- passing dossier and contract self-check artifacts
- an explicit non-parity list when we are weaker than commercial DOE software
- fermentation-specific warnings generic DOE software would not have forced
